# tic_tac_toe
Created a simple tic-tac-toe game using JavaScript and HTML.

I watched a YouTube video and read a tutorial, with both offering different ways of combining HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make an interactive tic-tac-toe game playable in the browser.

The easiest part was using HTML and CSS to work on constructing the layout, whiile the more difficult part came in making sure I had the JavaScript code lined up precisely and correctly.

After I get the MVP going, I'll be working on jazzing it up with better graphics and interactive features.
